## About This Site

Welcome to Teaching Physics, a growing collection of ideas, resources, and reflections for physics teachers.

This site brings together materials developed through years of classroom experience, teacher training, and collaboration across the physics education community. Whether you're new to teaching or a seasoned practitioner, you'll find practical resources designed to save time, spark curiosity, and deepen understanding — both for students and teachers.

Here you'll find:

- Tried-and-tested lesson activities
- Conceptual explanations and teaching tips
- Assessment ideas and feedback strategies
- Practical experiments and demos (with data and videos)
- Technology and datalogger guides
- Reflections on pedagogy, curriculum, and professional development

The site is informed by experience teaching GCSE, IGCSE, and A-level Physics, as well as international work supporting teachers in different contexts. It also draws on insights from working with the Institute of Physics and helping to establish a successful sixth form.

This is an ongoing project — part resource hub, part professional diary. It’s a place to share what works (and what doesn’t), to celebrate the joy of teaching physics, and to keep growing as educators.

Thanks for visiting — and if something here helps you, inspires you, or gets your students asking more questions, then it’s done its job.
